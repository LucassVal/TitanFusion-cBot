## 🎯 Architecture (The 4 Layers)

Titan Fusion isn't just a bot; it's a **Quantum Engine** that processes market data through 4 strict validation layers before taking any action.

### **L1: Technical & Structural Analysis (The Quant Lab)**

This layer is the "Mathematical Backbone" of the system. Before any AI inference, Python locally executes a **High-Performance Quant Scan** calculating 10+ professional indicators to build a "Bio-Scan" of the asset.

*   **13 Elite Patterns:** Automatically detects *Liquidity Sweeps, Fair Value Gaps (FVG), CHoCH, Wyckoff Springs, Order Blocks*, and more.
*   **L1+ Structure (Local):** Python natively calculates *Trend Bias (EMA)*, *Volatility (Bollinger Squeeze)*, and *Key Levels*.
*   **Scan Grid:** A visual matrix in the console showing the status of every pattern across M5, M15, M30, H1, and H4 timeframes.

#### **The Quant Matrix: Indicator x Strategy Mapping**
We calculate 10+ specific indices. Each one serves a critical role in validating specific strategies:

| Indicator / Metric | Function | Fast Scalp (M5) | Day Scalp (M15) | Momentum (H1) | Swing (H4) |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **EMA Triple (20/50/200)** | Trend Alignment | ❌ Ignore | ✅ Required | ✅ Strict | ✅ Strict |
| **MACD (12,26,9)** | Trend Momentum | ❌ Ignore | ❌ Ignore | ✅ Signal Line | ✅ Histogram |
| **RSI (14)** | Overbought/Sold | ✅ Reversion | ✅ Divergence | ❌ Ignore | ❌ Ignore |
| **Stochastics (14,3,3)** | Fast Timing | ✅ Trigger | ✅ Trigger | ❌ Ignore | ❌ Ignore |
| **Williams %R** | Exhaustion | ✅ Extreme | ❌ Ignore | ❌ Ignore | ✅ Reversal |
| **Bollinger Width** | Volatility Cycle | ✅ Squeeze | ✅ Expansion | ✅ Breakout | ❌ Ignore |
| **ATR (14)** | Real Volatility | ✅ Dynamic TP/SL | ✅ Dynamic TP/SL | ✅ Dynamic TP/SL | ✅ Dynamic TP/SL |
| **OBV (On Balance Vol)**| Accumulation | ❌ Ignore | ❌ Ignore | ✅ Flow Check | ✅ Confirmation|
| **VWAP** | Inst. Fair Value | ❌ Ignore | ✅ Support/Res | ✅ Trend Filter | ❌ Ignore |
| **Flow Score** | Proprietary Algo | ❌ Ignore | ❌ Ignore | ✅ REQUIRED | ✅ REQUIRED |

> **Note:** "Ignore" means the AI is instructed to downweight that metric for that specific mode, preventing noise (e.g., ignoring RSI in a strong Momentum trade).

### **L2: Market Sentiment (Contrarian)**
*   **Real-Time Broker Data:** Reads the "Crowd Sentiment" directly from cTrader.
*   **The 75/25 Rule:** 
    *   If Crowd Buy > 75% -> **BLOCKS BUYS** (Sentient: Overbought).
    *   If Crowd Buy < 25% -> **BLOCKS SELLS** (Sentient: Oversold).
*   **Divergence Detection:** Identifies when Price is falling but Sentiment is rising (Smart Money accumulation).

### **L3: Artificial Intelligence (The Brain)**
*   **Gemini 2.0 Flash:** Receives the pre-digested L1+L2 data.
*   **Prompt Engineering v3:** Uses a "Persona-based" prompt to act as an Institutional Trader.
*   **Decision:** Determines the Strategy (*Scalp, Momentum, Swing*) and Confidence level. Only trades if Confidence > 75%.

### **L4: Management & Integrity**
*   **Portfolio Guard:** Prevents overexposure by limiting max 3 open positions per symbol.
*   **Risk Guard:** Hard-coded limits on SL/TP (e.g., Max SL 0.3% for Scalp) that override AI hallucinations.
*   **Supervisor:** A background process that validates the success of L1, L2, L3, and L4 every cycle.

## 🚀 Key Features (v1.1)

### 📊 **Visual "War Room" Log**
The terminal provides a military-grade dashboard of what the bot is thinking:
```text
  🔍 ANALYZING XAUUSD:
    [L1 DNA]       Digits: 2 | Pip: 0.01 | MinVol: 1
    [L1 Scan]      Pattern Status (13/13):
      - M5 : [S:🟢 F:🔴 C:__ W:__ ...]
    [L2 Sentiment] 🚨 DIVERGENCE: Crowd Extreme Buying -> Look for SELL
    [L3 Decision]  ⛔ WAIT (Scalp) | Conf: 60% | Reason: H4 trend conflict
    [L4 Mgmt]      Monitoring 2 orders | 🟢 In Profit
  [INTEGRITY] ✅ CYCLE VALIDATED (L1,L2,L3,L4 OK) | Latency: 0.85s
```

###  dziennik **Journaling System**
*   Every Approved Signal is saved to `Documents/TitanFusionAI/Journal/`.
*   You get a permanent text record of every trade decision for later review.
